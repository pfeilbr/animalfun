h1. Animal Fun

Animal Fun is a simple animal learning program for children.  Children learn about animals by seeing and hearing 
the sounds an animal makes.  It combines an easy-to-use interface and fun sound effects to entertain children while
they learn.

The animal pictures and sound effects are from the free wonderful "Tux Paint":http://tuxpaint.org desktop (Mac, Windows, Linux) drawing program 
for children.  If you enjoy the pictures and sounds, head over to "http://tuxpaint.org":http://tuxpaint.org to download for free.

Animal Fun is free, Open Source software, distributed under the terms of the GNU "General Public License":http://github.com/pfeilbr/animalfun/blob/master/LICENSE.
